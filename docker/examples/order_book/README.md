# Order Book Example

This example is taken from the [Griffin documentation](https://docs.txpipe.io/griffin/order_book/introduction). It consists of three main actions: creating, cancelling and resolving orders. The order book contract is implemented with Aiken in the [`order_book/contract`](../../../wallet/src/eutxo_examples/order_book/contract/) directory. We provide example JSON files for each action.
